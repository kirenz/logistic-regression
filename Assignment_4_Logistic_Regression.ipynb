    "**Data Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Happiness Report ranks 156 countries by their happiness levels (`Happiness.Score`). The rankings come from the Gallup World Poll and are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This is called the Cantril ladder: it asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The rankings are from nationally representative samples, for the years 2013-2015. They are based entirely on the survey scores, using the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other variables in the dataset show the estimated extent to which each of the factors contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the worldâ€™s lowest national averages for each of the factors (for more information about the data, visit this [FAQ-site](https://s3.amazonaws.com/happiness-report/2016/FAQ_2016.pdf) or the [World Happiness Report-site](http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2016/)).\n",

Furthermore, use the results from the confusion matrix and create the following variables: true positive; true negative; false positive and false negative. Use these variables to calculate the following measures: \"Accuracy\", Precision\" (what proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?), \"Recall\" (what proportion of actual positives was identified correctly) and the F1 score (measure of a test's accuracy) for the thresholds in c1), c2) and c3). Which threshold would you recommend? \n",

These two quantities are related to the **F1 score**, which is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall: $F1 = 2* ((Precision * Recall)/(Precision + Recall)).$\n",
